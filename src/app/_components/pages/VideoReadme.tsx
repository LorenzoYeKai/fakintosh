      <br />
      <p>
        You&apos;ve found the Movies folder. Here you can find a selection of
        clips from movies or videos that I like. Every clip here resonates with
        me in some way, whether it&apos;s about engineering, art, or just pure
        curiosity.

      <p className="text-xl font-bold">Engineers turn dreams into reality</p>
      <p>
        A scene from The Wind Rises, where Caproni drops this absolute truth. As
        an engineer, this line hits deep.

      <br />
      <p className="text-xl font-bold">Running Away</p>
      <p>
        The breathtaking running scene from The Tale of Princess Kaguya. Isao
        Takahata&apos;s masterpiece, raw, emotional, unforgettable.

      <p className="text-xl font-bold">Do Chairs Exist?</p>
      <p>
        A Vsauce video. Philosophy, science, and existential confusionâ€”all in
        one. I miss full-length Vsauce videos.

        The Transformative Power of Classical Music
      </p>
      <p>
        A TED talk by Benjamin Zander. If you think classical music isn&apos;t
        for you, watch this. Trust me.

      <p className="text-xl font-bold">Into the Void - The Meaning of White</p>
      <p>
        A deep and thought-provoking exploration of... something. You should
        definitely click on this one.
