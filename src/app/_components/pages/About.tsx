        I'm Lorenzo, a builder at heart. Over the past three years, I&apos;ve
        been busy creating a startup from scratch—wearing all the hats, breaking
        (and fixing) things, and learning more than I ever thought possible.
        It&apos;s been a wild ride, and while it&apos;s not taking off like I
        hoped, the lessons were worth the journey.{" "}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        But building isn&apos;t just work for me—it&apos;s a way of life. I love{" "}
        <strong>learning, experimenting, and creating</strong>, whether it's
        writing code, making music, playing games, or just doing something
        ridiculous for fun. Life's too short to be boring.{" "}

        This isn&apos;t your typical portfolio. Instead of a static page with a
        list of skills (🥱), I wanted to make something{" "}
        <strong>interactive</strong>—a playground that feels like a familiar OS
        but with a few surprises along the way. Navigate through the "files,"
        mess around with the "terminal," and keep an eye out for{" "}
        <strong>hidden Easter eggs</strong>.

        Have fun exploring, and if you want to chat, you know where to find me.
