        This is where my past projects rest. Some were bad ideas and some were{" "}
        <strong>good but unsustainable</strong>. A <strong>builder</strong>{" "}
        inevitably has to <strong>kill</strong> many projects before finding one
        that&apos;s truly worth building.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Letting go of a project is hard. You pour time, energy, and passion into
        something, only to realize it&apos;s not working. But that&apos;s part
        of the <strong>learning process</strong>. Every project in this folder
        taught me something, and that&apos;s what matters.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        There&apos;s nothing wrong with moving on.{" "}
        <strong>We must keep building</strong>.
